# SkipAssist
A browser extension to skip the intro credits when watching a show on Netflix

## Somethings To Note
* This extension only works for Netflix. Support for other streaming services is being worked on.
* The extension will automatically skip 2 seconds after the 'Skip Intro' button is displayed.
* Some properties used to find the UI layout and button is subject to change by the development team at Netflix.

## How To Install
* Clone the extension into any directory you want.
```
git clone https://github.com/Stylll/SkipAssist.git
```

* Open Chrome Browser and go to the extensions page.
```
1. You can type chrome://extensions in the url to open the extensions page.
2. Or click the three dots at the top right, click 'More Tools' and click 'Extensions'
```

* On the extensions page, click the 'Load unpacked' button at the top left and navigate to the 'SkipAssist' folder in the popup window. (Make sure it's the folder that is selected and not the contents in the folder)

* Once that is done, the extension should be added to chrome and you can enjoy Netflix without having to click the 'Skip Intro' button.
